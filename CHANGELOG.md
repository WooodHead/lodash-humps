## [2.0.0]
> 2016-07-28

Drop support for passing a string. Use `_.camelCase()` instead.

## [1.1.1]
> 2016-07-19

Do not camelCase all values, only object values!

## [1.1.0]
> 2016-07-19

Yep, I was a little premature on the 1.0 release.
No longer need `require('lodash-humps').default`. See issue #2.
Thanks @jdalton for making the build process so much better.

## [1.0.0]
